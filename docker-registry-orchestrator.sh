# +--------------------+
# SUMMARY
# +--------------------+

# 1) Builds (and uploads) Docker Images a remote Docker Registry
# 2) Checks if an Docker Image (in the remote registry) has been modified OUTSIDE of this script


# +--------------------+
# ASSUMPTIONS
# +--------------------+

# 1. Script should be triggered every 24 hours AND when Dockerfile modifications are made (at a minimum)

# 2. Dockerfiles pull in package updates on every build

# 3. Docker Image changes (in git) must be approved by a trusted entity
#   (Trivy can't find ALL docker vulnerabilities)

# 4. Script expects the following convention (shared with docker-scan.sh):
#     trivy-tutorial/docker-builder/registry-repos/REPO_NAME/Dockerfile
#     (e.g., trivy-tutorial/docker-builder/registry-repos/trivy-tutorial/Dockerfile)

# +--------------------+
# INPUTS
# +--------------------+

# Docker Tags are a way to version Docker Images
# In this demo, we build Docker Images with the "latest" tag
TAG="$1"

## In this demo, zachroofsec
DOCKERHUB_USER="$2"

    # TAMPERING CHECKS SUMMARY
    # +--------------------+

    # preexisting controls
    # (i.e., Trivy scan, Pull Request Approval)

    # We need to ensure that a malicious Docker Image has NOT been placed in
    # the Docker Registry

    # For additional tampering checks, you should also use Docker Content Trust
    # (outside the scope of this tutorial)
